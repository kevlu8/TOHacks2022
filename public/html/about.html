				We are a group of students from a junior high located in Edmonton, Alberta.<br />
				This was a project made for TOHacks 2022. We hope you enjoy our website!<br />

				Having a low amount of friends is a problem for many people. Friends are supposed to be there to cheer you up when you're sad and to help you out when you're stressed. Not having anyone that can help you is detrimental to your mental health. Studies have shown that this concept is a sad reality for many people around the globe.
				<br />
				<br />
				We hope that FriendApp will be able to help for this cause by helping people find friends that can help them out.
