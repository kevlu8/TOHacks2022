				Having a low amount of friends is a problem for many people. Friends are supposed to be there to cheer you up when you're sad and to help you out when you're stressed. Not having anyone that can help you is detrimental to your mental health. Studies have shown that this concept is a sad reality for many people around the globe.
				<br />
				<br />
				By doing this, we are able to help people with mental health disorders. This is a social issue that we are trying to solve.
